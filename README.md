# Plearance - 優雅なひだ

An independent designer brand inspired by the art of pleats, reimagined as a high-end minimalist Vue.js application.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This project transforms the original static website into a sophisticated digital experience that embodies:

- **High-End Minimalism**: Classic black & white palette with subtle gray-blue accents
- **Editorial Layout Design**: Magazine-style asymmetric grids with generous negative space
- **Art Gallery Aesthetic**: Each page flows like a curated exhibition
- **Immersive Storytelling**: Brand narrative unfolds through visual hierarchy and typography

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

- **Vue 3 + TypeScript**: Modern, type-safe development
- **Vue Router**: Seamless single-page application navigation
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast build tool and development server
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop refinement
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient build system and asset management

## ✨ Key Features

### Design System
- **Typography**: Crimson Text (serif) for headings, Inter (sans-serif) for body text
- **Color Palette**: Monochromatic with strategic accent colors
- **Layout Grid**: Asymmetrical editorial layouts with pleat-inspired animations
- **Interactive Elements**: Subtle hover effects mimicking fabric movement

### User Experience
